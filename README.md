# filler
Game where enemies compete who can place more random pieces on the board. The board is fixed and receives piece to be placed until a player gives incorrent coordinate or a piece cannot be placed anymore. The piece is randomly generated by the intermediary virtual machine which hands out board and piece to be placed for player executables.

## Getting Started
Run **make** in root folder and player executable will be created. **players** folder in **resources** folder consists of executables ready for the battle. **resources** folder also stores maps for the game. **resources/maps** folder consists of small map (map00), medium size map (map01) and big map (map02). After copying the executable to **resources/players folder**, the game can be launched by running in terminal
```
./filler_vm -p1 players/lskrauci.filler -p2 players/carli.filler -v -f maps/map00
```
The filler_vm hands out random pieces to both players (executables) who need to place as many as they can
while blocking the enemy from doing the same. **-p1** denotes player 1 executable and **-p2** denotes player 2 executable.

Here it can be seen that the coordinates were found to be 16 vertically and 3 horizontally.

Next gif illustrates full game. The player who can successfully block or trap enemy has the advantage to continue placing more pieces until no more piece can be placed. Player who places more pieces wins with having the highest score.
